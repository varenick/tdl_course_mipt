# Theories of Deep Learning course

This is a GitHub page of Theories of Deep Learning course held by Neural Networks and Deep Learning Lab., MIPT. The working language of this course is Russian.

Lectures slides and homework assignments will be placed in this repo.

Location: Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Phystech.Bio building, room *TBA*

This course will (normally) start at the second week of February, 2019 (after 12-th of February). If you are going to be present at lectures, please, vote for the day and time at Doodle: https://doodle.com/poll/kvfd3fih7hsvftms .

Also, we are going to take videos (we are not sure about the quality, though).

Further announcements will be in our Telegram chat: https://t.me/joinchat/D_ljjxJHIrD8IuFvfqVLPw
